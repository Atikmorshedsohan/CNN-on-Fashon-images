Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset.
The trained model is further evaluated on real-world smartphone images, bridging the gap between benchmark datasets and practical usage.

The complete workflow is designed to be fully reproducible using Google Colab, with no manual file uploads required during execution.
